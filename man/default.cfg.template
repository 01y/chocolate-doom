.TH default.cfg 5
.SH NAME
default.cfg \- @PACKAGE_NAME@ configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIdefault.cfg\fR
is the configuration file for \fB@PROGRAM_SPREFIX@\-doom\fR(6).  The configuration
options stored in the file are the same as those stored in the
original DOS Vanilla Doom. 
Extra @PACKAGE_NAME@-specific options are stored in a separate 
configuration file, \fB@PROGRAM_SPREFIX@\-doom.cfg\fR.
.PP
\fIdefault.cfg\fR is normally stored in the user's home directory,
as \fI~/.local/share/@PROGRAM_SPREFIX@\-doom/default.cfg\fR.  The path can be
overridden using the \fBXDG_DATA_HOME\fR environment variable (see the XDG
Base Directory Specification).
.PP
The \fB@PROGRAM_SPREFIX@\-setup\fR(6) tool provides a simple to use front-end
for editing \fIdefault.cfg\fR.

.SH FILE FORMAT
The file is a plain-text file, consisting of a list of configuration
options and their values, separated by whitespace.  Each option is stored
on a separate line.  Options have different types; an option may have 
either an integer, floating point or string value.  If the option is
of a string type, the value is surrounded by quotes (").
.PP
For example:
.RS
.PP
integer_value                1
.br
integer_value2               1
.br
floating_point_value         4.2
.br
string_value                 "hello world"
.RE
.PP
Invalid lines or comments in the file will be ignored, but it is advisable
not to put them in the file; the file is rewritten from scratch every time
the game exits, so any invalid lines or comments will be lost.
.PP
Some options are used for keyboard key bindings; these are stored as 
integer values containing the keyboard scan code of the key to be bound to.
Boolean values are also stored as integers, with a value of zero usually
indicating "false" and a non-zero value indicating "true".
