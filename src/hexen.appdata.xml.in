    <p>
      @PACKAGE_SHORTNAME@ Hexen is a conservative,
      historically-accurate Hexen source port, which is compatible
      with mods and levels that were made before the Hexen source code
      was released.  Unlike other source ports, the goal is to
      preserve the original look, feel, limitations, and bugs of the
      original DOS executable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full support for single- and multi-player games is provided.
      Unlike the original executable, network play is implemented on
      the IP network stack, allowing it to function on modern LANs and
      the Internet.
