Thanks for contributing to Chocolate Doom! Whatever your contribution,
whether it's code or just a bug report, it's greatly appreciated.

### Reporting bugs

Before reporting a bug, it's worth checking if this really is a bug.
Chocolate Doom's mission is to reproduce the Vanilla (DOS) versions of
the Doom engine games, bugs and all. Check out the
[NOT-BUGS](../NOT-BUGS) file for a list of common issues which aren't
really bugs at all. You might also try searching [the GitHub issues
list](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/issues) to see
if your bug has already been reported.

If you're confident that you've found a real bug (or even if you're
not sure!) please go ahead and [file an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/issues/new).
You'll need a GitHub account, but it's pretty easy to sign up.

Please try to give as much information as possible:

* What version of Chocolate Doom are you using? Check the title bar of
  the window for the version number.

* Chocolate Doom runs on many different operating systems (not just
  Windows!). Please say which operating system and what version of it
  you're using.

* Please say which game you're playing (Doom 1, Doom 2, Heretic,
  Hexen, Strife, etc.) and list any add-on WADs you're using. Please
  mention if you have any special configuration you think may be
  relevant, too.

### Feature requests

Chocolate Doom is always open to new feature requests; however, please
be aware that the project is designed around a deliberately limited
[philosophy](../PHILOSOPHY), and many features from other source ports
will not be accepted. Here are a few common requests which are often
rejected:

* "High resolution" rendering (greater than 320x200 display).

* An option to disable Vanilla limits, such as the visplane rendering
  limit.

* Ability to play "No Rest For The Living", the expansion pack which
  comes with the XBLA / BFG Edition of Doom.

But if you're not sure whether your feature is in line with the
project philosophy, don't worry - just ask!
To make a feature request, just [file an issue on
GitHub](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom/issues/new).
