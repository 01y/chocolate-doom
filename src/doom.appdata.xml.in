      @PACKAGE_SHORTNAME@ Doom is a conservative,
      historically-accurate Doom source port, which is compatible with
      the thousands of mods and levels that were made before the Doom
      source code was released.  Unlike other source ports, the goal
      is to preserve the original look, feel, limitations, and bugs of
      the original DOS executable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full support for single- and multi-player games is provided, for
      all of the original Doom games, Chex Quest, and Hacx.  Unlike
      the original executable, network play is implemented on the IP
      network stack, allowing it to function on modern LANs and the
      Internet.
