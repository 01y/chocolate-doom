Competition Doom is a Doom source port which aims to behave as closely
as possible to the original DOS Doom executables.

Competition Doom aims to:

 * Be compatible with DOS Doom demos
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom configuration files
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom savegames
 * Be compatible with DOS Doom bugs
 * Provide the same "feel" as DOS Doom (display and input should behave
   the same)
 * As far as possible, provide all the same features that are available
   using the DOS version.

== Setting up gameplay ==

For instructions on how to set up Competition Doom for play, see the
INSTALL file.

== Configuration File ==

Competition Doom is compatible with the DOS Doom configuration file
(normally named 'default.cfg').  Existing configuration files for DOS
Doom should therefore simply work out of the box.  However, Competition
Doom also provides some extra settings.  These are stored in a
separate file named 'cndoom.cfg'.

The configuration can be edited using the cnsetup tool.

== Command-line options ==

For a complete list of command-line options, see the CMDLINE file.

== Playing TCs ==

With Vanilla Doom there is no way to include sprites in PWAD files.
Competition Doom's '-file' command line option behaves exactly the same
as Vanilla Doom, and trying to play TCs by adding the WAD files using
'-file' will not work.

Many Total Conversions (TCs) are distributed as a PWAD file which must
be merged into the main IWAD.  Typically a copy of DEUSF.EXE is
included which performs this merge.  Competition Doom includes a new
option, '-merge', which will simulate this merge.  Essentially, the
WAD directory is merged in memory, removing the need to modify the
IWAD on disk.

To play TCs using Competition Doom, run like this:

  cndoom -merge thetc.wad

Here are some examples:

  cndoom -merge batman.wad -deh batman.deh vbatman.deh  (Batman Doom)
  cndoom -merge aoddoom1.wad -deh aoddoom1.deh  (Army of Darkness Doom)

 * More information, including information about how to play various
   classic TCs, is available on the Competition Doom website:

   You are encouraged to sign up and contribute any useful information
   you may have regarding the port!

 * Competition Doom is not perfect.  Although it aims to accurately
   emulate Vanilla Doom, some of the behavior of Vanilla Doom can be
   very difficult to reproduce. Because of the nature of the project,
   you may also encounter Vanilla Doom bugs; these are intentionally
   present; see the NOT-BUGS file for more information.

   New bug reports can be submitted to the Competition Doom bug tracker
   on Sourceforge.  See:

 * Source code patches are welcome, but please follow the style
   guidelines - see the file named HACKING included with the source
   distribution.

 * Competition Doom is distributed under the GNU GPL.  See the COPYING
   file for more information.
