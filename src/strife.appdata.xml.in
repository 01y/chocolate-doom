    <p>
      @PACKAGE_SHORTNAME@ Strife is a conservative,
      historically-accurate recreation of the Strife engine.  It is
      completely compatible with the original game and mods created
      with the original engine in mind.  Made with a great reverse
      engineering effort, it has the goal of preserving the original
      look, feel, limitations, and bugs of the original DOS
      executable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full support for single- and multi-player games is provided.
      Unlike the original executable, network play is implemented on
      the IP network stack, allowing it to function on modern LANs and
      the Internet.
